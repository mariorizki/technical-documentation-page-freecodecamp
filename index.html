          The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (<a
            class="external-link"
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/"
            target="_blank"
            >a W3C Candidate Recommendation as</a
          >
          of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out,
          align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their
          size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
        </p>
        <p>
          The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the
          ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the
          available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices
          and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available
          free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed
          to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline
          which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they
          lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex
          applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing,
          resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the
          components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the
          <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
            class="external-link"
            target="_blank"
            >Grid</a
          >
          layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

          Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves
          a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them
          are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex
          container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children
          (said “flex items”).
        </p>
        <p>
          If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions,
          the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look
          at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind
          the flex layout.

        <p>
          Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start
          to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>main axis</strong> – The main axis of a flex container is
            the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is
            not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction
            property (see below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>main-start | main-end</strong> – The flex items are placed
            within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>main size</strong> – A flex item’s width or height,
            whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The
            flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’
            property, whichever is in the main dimension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross axis</strong> – The axis perpendicular to the main
            axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main
            axis direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross-start | cross-end</strong> – Flex lines are filled
            with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start
            side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross size</strong> – The width or height of a flex item,
            whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The
            cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in
            the cross dimension.
          </li>

            This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the
            given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            <code>
 .container {
    display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
 }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <div class="subtheme">

          <img src="./images/flex-direction.svg" alt="" />
          <p>
            This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex
            items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from
            optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex
            items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical
            columns.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            <code>
 .container {
    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | 
    column | column-reverse;
 }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <ul>
            <li>row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl</li>
            <li>row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl</li>
            <li>column: same as row but top to bottom</li>
            <li>column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subtheme">
          <h4>flex-wrap</h4>
          <img src="./images/flex-wrap.svg" alt="" />
          <p>
            By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can
            change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this
            property.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
            <code>
 .container {
    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
 }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <ul>
            <li>nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line</li>
            <li>
              wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to
              bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
              wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom
              to top.
