          The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (<a
            class="external-link"
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/"
            target="_blank"
            >a W3C Candidate Recommendation as</a
          >
          of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out,
          align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their
          size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
        </p>
        <p>
          The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the
          ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the
          available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices
          and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available
          free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed
          to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline
          which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they
          lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex
          applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing,
          resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the
          components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the
          <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
            class="external-link"
            target="_blank"
            >Grid</a
          >
          layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

          Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves
          a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them
          are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex
          container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children
          (said “flex items”).
        </p>
        <p>
          If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions,
          the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look
          at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind
          the flex layout.
        </p>

        <p>
          Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start
          to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>main axis</strong> – The main axis of a flex container is
            the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is
            not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction
            property (see below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>main-start | main-end</strong> – The flex items are placed
            within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>main size</strong> – A flex item’s width or height,
            whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The
            flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’
            property, whichever is in the main dimension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross axis</strong> – The axis perpendicular to the main
            axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main
            axis direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross-start | cross-end</strong> – Flex lines are filled
            with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start
            side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cross size</strong> – The width or height of a flex item,
            whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The
            cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in
            the cross dimension.

                This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the
                given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct
                children.

              <p>
                This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex
                items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from
                optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of
                flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or
                vertical columns.

                By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You
                can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this
                property.

                This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap
                properties, which together define the flex container’s main and
                cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.

                This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps
                distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex
                items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached
                their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the
                alignment of items when they overflow the line.

                  <strong>space-between</strong> items are evenly distributed in

                </li>

                  <strong>space-around</strong>: items are evenly distributed in
                  the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the
                  spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on
                  both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against
                  the container edge, but two units of space between the next
                  item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.

                <li>
                  <strong>space-evenly</strong>: items are distributed so that
                  the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges)
                  is equal.

              </ul>
              <p>
                Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For
                example, space-between never got support from some versions of
                Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN
                <a href="" class="external-link">has detailed charts</a>. The
                safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.

              <p>
                There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these
                values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do
                this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it
                renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content
                can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).

                This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid
                out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the
                justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the

                  placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between
                  these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction

                The safe and unsafe modifier keywords can be used in conjunction
                with all the rest of these keywords (although note
                <a href="" class="external-link">browser support</a>), and deal
                with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content

                This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra

                By default, flex items are laid out in the source order.
                However, the order property controls the order in which they
                appear in the flex container.
              </p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
                <code>

              <p>
                This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.
                It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It
                dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex
                container the item should take up.
              </p>
              <p>
                If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the
                container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of
                the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up
                twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

                This defines the default size of an element before the remaining
                space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.)
                or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height
                property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword
                until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on
                the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so
                it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren
                max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.

              </pre>
              <p>
                If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in.
                If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its
                flex-grow value.

                This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis
                combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and
                flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you
                set it with a single number value, it’s like 1 0.

          <h3>Prefixing Flexbox</h3>
        </header>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Flexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers
          possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the
          vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and
          value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time,
          creating an “old”, “tweener”, and “new” versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the best way to handle this is to write in the new (and final)
          syntax and run your CSS through Autoprefixer, which handles the
          fallbacks very well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, here’s a Sass @mixin to help with some of the
          prefixing, which also gives you an idea of what kind of things need to
          be done:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-css">
          <code>
 @mixin flexbox() {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -moz-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: flex;
 }

 @mixin flex($values) {
  -webkit-box-flex: $values;
  -moz-box-flex: $values;
  -webkit-flex: $values;
  -ms-flex: $values;
  flex: $values;
 } 

 @mixin order($val) {
  -webkit-box-ordinal-group: $val;
  -moz-box-ordinal-group: $val;
  -ms-flex-order: $val;
  -webkit-order: $val;
  order: $val;
 }

 .wrapper {
  @include flexbox();
 }

 .item {
  @include flex(1 200px);
